New package `@real-a11y-dev/snapshot` — the snapshot engine, extracted from `@real-a11y-dev/cli`. It owns the deterministic finding fingerprints, the diffable `a11y-snapshot.json` artifact, the findings/views/unified diff, and baselines, depending on nothing but `@real-a11y-dev/audit` and `@real-a11y-dev/core`. It's Node-only (`node:crypto`) and never enters the page bundle, which makes it the single place a snapshot is captured and compared — so a snapshot taken by the CLI and diffed by the MCP server (or vice-versa) is byte-for-byte identical. The `CliError` the artifact and baseline readers used to throw is now a domain `SnapshotFormatError`.

**Breaking for `@real-a11y-dev/cli`: it no longer exposes a programmatic `.` library entry — the CLI is a command, not a library.** Everything the old `api` surface re-exported (fingerprints, the artifact, the findings/views/unified diff, baselines, sanitization) now lives in `@real-a11y-dev/snapshot`; import it from there instead. The `real-a11y` binary — its commands, flags, output, and exit codes — is byte-for-byte unchanged (verified against the CLI e2e suite). The CLI also drops its direct `@real-a11y-dev/core` dependency (it followed the engine into `snapshot`) and gains `@real-a11y-dev/snapshot`.
