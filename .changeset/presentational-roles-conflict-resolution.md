Implement ARIA's **Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution** in the DOM tree producer. `role="presentation"` / `role="none"` is now ignored — and the element exposed with its **implicit** role — when the element is focusable or carries a global ARIA state/property, and `<img alt="">` is presentational only when nothing else names it.

Three elements that were wrong before:

- `<a href="/about" role="presentation">` reported `role: "presentation"`. It was kept in the tree (a focusable carve-out already existed) but under the decorative role, so every consumer reading `role` saw a presentation node where a screen reader announces a link. It now reports `link` — likewise `<button role="none">`, and anything made focusable by `tabindex`.
- `<h2 role="presentation" aria-label="Quarterly results">` dropped out of the tree entirely, taking the heading with it. A global ARIA property voids presentation, so it is a `heading` again — and visible to heading-order checks, which is where its absence actually hurt.
- `<img alt="" title="Company logo">` dropped out. Per HTML-AAM an empty `alt` is presentational only absent other naming, so it is now an `img` named `"Company logo"`. The `title` fallback in accessible-name computation was being short-circuited by the empty `alt`, so the name had to be fixed alongside the role or the tree would have gained an exposed but nameless image. A bare `<img alt="">` is still decorative and still drops.

Three deliberate limits, each one a way this could have gone wrong:

- **`aria-hidden` does not void presentation.** It removes the element from the tree outright, so letting it restore a role would resurrect something nobody can reach.
- **A global attribute counts only when it says something.** `aria-label=""` and `title="   "` state nothing and leave the decorative role alone — honouring them would expose a permanently nameless node.
- **`<img alt="">` is gated on the _naming_ attributes** (`title`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`) plus focusability, not on the full global set that voids an explicit `role="presentation"`. `<img alt="" aria-describedby="…">` stays decorative: exposing it would put a nameless `img` in the tree, and every "image has no accessible name" check would then flag markup that is correctly marked decorative.

Focusability for this purpose is stricter than the `interaction.isFocusable` facet, which is tag-based and counts every `<a>` and `<input>`. An `<a>` without `href`, a `disabled` control and `<input type="hidden">` are not tab stops, so their decorative role stands and they flatten exactly as before. The facet itself is unchanged.

### Breaking change

Tree output changes for pages containing any of the three shapes above, so committed snapshots and assertions that encode the old output will fail.

**Migration.** Re-record your snapshots (`vitest -u`, or regenerate the CLI/MCP baseline you compare against) and read the diff: each changed line is a place where the tree now matches what assistive tech announces. Two patterns are worth fixing in the page rather than the baseline — a `role="presentation"` on a link or button does nothing and can be deleted, and an `<img alt="">` that turned out to have a `title` was never decorative. Assertions that relied on such a node being **absent** need inverting; assertions that matched `role: "presentation"` on a focusable element should match its implicit role instead.
