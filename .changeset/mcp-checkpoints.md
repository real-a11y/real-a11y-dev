Add **a11y snapshot checkpoints** to the MCP server — six tools that give an AI agent the CLI's snapshot + diff power mid-session: capture a page, change something (deploy, feature toggle, DOM edit), then ask what accessibility findings are new / changed / fixed, with the _same_ `v1:` fingerprint identity the CI a11y-diff bot uses.

- `checkpoint_findings` / `diff_findings` — snapshot the current page under a name, then re-snapshot and diff against it.
- `diff_checkpoints` — diff two already-stored checkpoints.
- `list_checkpoints` / `export_checkpoint` / `import_checkpoint` — inspect the store, and bridge to/from CLI-generated `a11y-snapshot.json` artifacts.

Checkpoints are in-memory, LRU-capped (20), and **survive navigation by design** — so you can `checkpoint_findings("prod")`, open a preview URL, and `diff_findings("prod")` for a cross-deploy accessibility diff in one session. `close_browser` clears them.

`@real-a11y-dev/snapshot` gains **`buildSnapshotPage()`** — the single capture→fingerprint assembler the CLI's `snapshot` command and the MCP server both call, so their fingerprints are identical (guarded by a cross-tool golden test). `@real-a11y-dev/cli`'s snapshot command re-points to it with byte-for-byte identical output.
