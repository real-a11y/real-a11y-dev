Stop publishing `@real-a11y-dev/core`; the extraction engine is internal now.

It was the first package on npm and it is the last to go internal. Nobody installs an extraction engine on purpose — they install a matcher, a panel, a command, or a server, and the engine arrives inside it. Every published package already bundled it in practice; this makes that official. With it, the published set is **six packages**, down from thirteen.

**Nothing changes for you unless you imported `@real-a11y-dev/core` directly.** It moves to `devDependencies` and is bundled into all six, so they install fewer packages, not more — and each carries the exact engine version it was tested against, which is what `noExternal` already gave you unofficially.

If you did import it directly (last published `0.1.0-beta.13`), 19 of its 69 names keep a published home:

- `@real-a11y-dev/testing` re-exports the query and diff vocabulary — `findByRole`, `findAllByRole`, `diffTrees`, `getOutline`, `getTabSequence`, `linearize`, `ROLE_FILTER_GROUPS` — with `SemanticNode`, `ExtractionResult`, `TreeDiff`, `NodeChange`, `OutlineEntry`, `RoleFilter`, `FindByRoleOptions`, `ActionType` and `ActionResult`.
- `@real-a11y-dev/react` and `@real-a11y-dev/inspector` re-export the node, action and config types their own signatures name: `SemanticNode`, `ExtractionResult`, `TreeViewMode`, `ActionRequest`, `ActionResult`, plus `SemanticNavigatorConfig` on the inspector.

**The other 50 have no drop-in, and two of them are a real capability leaving: `extractA11yTree` and `extractDomTree`.** Building your own published tooling directly on the engine was a documented path in the getting-started guide, and it is not one any more. The replacement is a surface that carries the engine rather than an import: `real-a11y` for the shell and CI (`--format json`, `-o`), the MCP tools for an agent, `attach(page)` from `@real-a11y-dev/testing/playwright` for a Playwright suite, or `createInspector` / `<SemanticNavigator />` for a UI. Also gone without replacement: the live machinery (`LiveTreeExtractor`, `DomObserver`, `FocusManager`, `ActionDispatcher`, `createPicker`) and the native-AX vocabulary.

Two consumers changed shape rather than just moving a dependency line. `react` externalized `core` and now bundles it, and `storybook-addon`'s `index` entry listed it under `external` — correct while core was published, wrong the moment it wasn't, since npm cannot resolve a private package in the JS or in the types. Both entries genuinely need it: `react`'s `index.ts` re-exports core types and `useActiveModal` imports the _value_ `findByRole`, and `storybook-addon`'s `TreeMode` **is** core's `TreeViewMode`.

`inspector` had a latent version of the same gap — `noExternal` without the matching `dts.resolve` — which was harmless only because core was still published. Both halves are now paired everywhere.
