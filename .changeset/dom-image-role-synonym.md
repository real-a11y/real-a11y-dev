Treat `role="image"` as the `img` role. ARIA 1.3 adds `image` as a synonym of `img`, and Chromium exposes both as the same image role, never named by its content. The DOM producer kept the raw token, so `<span role="image">🎉</span>` came out as `image "🎉"` while the native producer reported a bare `img`. Nothing downstream recognised `image`: the `image-alt` rule skipped the element, named or not; `listByRole(root, "image")` and a role query for `img` missed it; and `toBeValidA11yTree` reported `"image" is not a valid ARIA role`.

An authored `role="image"` now extracts as `img`, and is named the way an `img` is: by `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `title`, never by its text. That includes a tag normally named by its content — `<button role="image">🎊</button>` was `image "🎊"` and is now an unnamed `img`, as Chromium computes it.

- **Snapshots:** a DOM-mode snapshot containing `role="image"` changes from `image "<text>"` to `img`, or `img "<label>"` when it has one. Re-record those baselines.
- **Assertions:** the `image-alt` rule (`collectFindings`) may now report an unlabeled `role="image"` it used to skip, and `toBeValidA11yTree` reports it as `role "img" requires an accessible name` instead of an invalid role. A labeled one now passes both. Fix a new failure with `aria-label`, or with `aria-labelledby` pointing at visible text.
- **`cli` / `mcp`:** only the tab sequence changes (`real-a11y tabs`, the `get_tab_order` tool), because it is the one view built by the in-page walk. A focusable `role="image"` now prints as `img` instead of `image "<text>"`. Native trees already reported `img` and are untouched.
