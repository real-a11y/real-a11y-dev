Halve the tree-search work done per keystroke. `applySearchFilter` ran the match predicate over the whole tree twice — once inside `searchTree` to build the visible set, then again to count the direct matches — so every character typed into the panel's search box paid for the string matching and `Object.entries` allocation of both passes. The two are now collected in one pass, and the loop that writes `ui.matchesFilter` folds the counting in rather than iterating the tree a second time.

`searchTree`'s ancestor-marking walk also climbed all the way to the root for every match, re-adding ids it had already marked: O(matches × depth) on a deep tree where the matches share a path. It now stops at the first ancestor already in the set, which is one climb per distinct path segment instead of one per match (and terminates rather than spinning if a malformed tree's `parentId` links form a cycle).

Behaviour is unchanged — same visible set, same direct-match count. This is the extraction/counting cost only; the panel still filters synchronously on each keystroke, with no input debounce.
