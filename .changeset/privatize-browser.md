Stop publishing `@real-a11y-dev/browser`; it is internal now.

The Playwright-backed `BrowserSession` was on npm as a way to script audits without an MCP client. That job is the CLI's: `real-a11y audit --format json -o report.json`, `--session` for multi-step flows across commands, the `click` / `focus` / `type` / `interact` verbs, and `diff` for CI. The `browser` package was the seam that made those possible, not a thing anyone adopted on purpose.

**Nothing changes for you unless you imported it directly.** It moves to `devDependencies` and is bundled into `cli`, `mcp` and `testing`, so those install fewer packages, not more.

If you did import it directly (last published `0.1.0-beta.13`): `@real-a11y-dev/mcp` re-exports `BrowserSession` along with `A11ySession`, `BrowserSessionOptions`, `PageSnapshot` and `SnapshotOptions`, so the types behind the `SessionManager` contract stay reachable. What is gone is a package you can install to obtain a session — the CLI is the supported route for driving a browser, and `@real-a11y-dev/testing/playwright`'s `attach()` remains public if you bring your own Playwright `Page`.

**The injected page-bundle is now inlined as source text rather than read from disk.** It used to be located by `new URL("./page-bundle.iife.global.js", import.meta.url)`, which is correct only while `browser` sits beside its own `dist/`. Bundled into a consumer, that resolves inside the consumer's dist where the file is not — so every `attach()` and page open would have failed at runtime, silently, because nothing type-checks a path and `verify` does not run the e2e suites. A lazy, cached `pageBundleSource()` replaces `PAGE_BUNDLE_PATH`; the bundle is embedded once per carrier by a build-time `define`, so a built artifact never touches the filesystem; running from source reads once and caches.

`@real-a11y-dev/testing` also tightens its optional `playwright` peer from `*` to `>=1.49.0 <2`. That range was `browser`'s, inherited transitively while it was a real dependency; moving it to `devDependencies` dropped it out of testing's published graph, so it is restated directly. If you had `playwright` below 1.49 alongside `testing`, you will now see a peer warning that was always warranted.
