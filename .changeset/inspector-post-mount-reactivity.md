Fix three ways the embeddable inspector stopped reacting after mount: a floating `<SemanticNavigator>` rendered an **empty panel** when its root ref was already set (the common `{open && <SemanticNavigator floating />}` toggle), `InspectorInstance.setViewMode()` and the `mode` prop left the rendered tree on the old view while `getTree()` already reported the new one, and `useSemanticTree`/`useActiveModal` never attached to a root that mounted after the first commit and kept observing a **replaced** root. `useSemanticTree` and `useActiveModal` now also accept the element itself (new `SemanticTreeTarget` type) — pass an element from a callback ref when the root mounts late or can be swapped; existing ref-object callers are unchanged.
