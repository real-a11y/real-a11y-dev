Tab-order serialization is now number-free by default; numbering moves to a render-time step.

`serializeTabSequence` used to render `01. link "Home"` / `02. button "Go"`. Inserting one focusable element near the top of the page renumbered every following line, so a committed snapshot's diff — and the reviewable unified-diff hunk of `real-a11y diff` — churned the whole view instead of showing the one inserted stop. Line order already conveys the sequence, so the serialized form is now just `link "Home"` / `button "Go"`: the canonical, diff-stable output you store and compare.

For a human- or agent-read listing where an explicit "stop 7" helps, a new `numberTabStops(tabs)` export re-adds the `NN. ` prefix at **render time** (never stored):

```ts
import { tabSequenceSnapshot, numberTabStops } from "@real-a11y-dev/testing";
numberTabStops(tabSequenceSnapshot(root)); // 01. link "Home"  02. button "Go"
```

Numbering is applied where output is read, not diffed: the CLI `tabs` terminal view, the MCP `get_tab_order` and `inspect_page` tools, and the extension's Markdown export (which stays numbered, matching its on-screen panel). It is absent where output is committed or diffed: `tabSequenceSnapshot()` in `@real-a11y-dev/testing`, the CLI `snapshot`/`inspect` artifacts and JSON, and the browser audit's `tabOrder`. (Also fixes an MCP snapshot summary that reported "0 tab stops" once lines were unnumbered.)

**Breaking change.** Any committed snapshot of a tab sequence (vitest/jest `toMatchSnapshot`, an inline snapshot, or a golden file / CI artifact) will differ by the removed `NN. ` prefix on every line.

**Migration.** Either re-generate the affected snapshots (`vitest -u`, `jest -u`, or re-capture the golden file), or wrap the value for display: `numberTabStops(tabSequenceSnapshot(root))`.

Structural diffing tolerates the transition: `real-a11y diff` still strips leading `NN. ` numbers before comparing, so a base captured by an older numbered tool version diffs cleanly in findings, the multiset view, and the plain-language statements. The one exception is the tabs **hunk** view — a legacy numbered base shows a one-time full rewrite there until it is re-captured. That output is advisory and never gates.
