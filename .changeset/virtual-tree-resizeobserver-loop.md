fix(ui): silence the benign "ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications" warning from the virtualized tree. The observer's re-measure now defers to a single `requestAnimationFrame`, breaking the synchronous observe→setState→relayout loop that Chromium reports (and which showed up in the extension's Errors panel). No behavior change to virtualization.
