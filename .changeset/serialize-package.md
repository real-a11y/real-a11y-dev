New package `@real-a11y-dev/serialize` — the canonical, deterministic text serialization of the accessibility tree: `serializeTree`, `serializeOutline`, and `serializeTabSequence`, each accepting a DOM root **or** a pre-extracted `@real-a11y-dev/core` tree. It's the single source of truth for the snapshot string format shared by the testing package, the docs panel, and (next) the Chrome extension's tree export.

`@real-a11y-dev/testing` now consumes this package and re-exports the serializers under its existing snapshot names (`auditSnapshot`, `outlineSnapshot`, `tabSequenceSnapshot`, `serializeTree`). No public API or output change — purely an internal extraction.
