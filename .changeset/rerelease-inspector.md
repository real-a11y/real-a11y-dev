"@real-a11y-dev/inspector": patch
---

Re-release to pick up this cycle's `@real-a11y-dev/core` and `@real-a11y-dev/semantic-navigator-ui` fixes, which the inspector bundles at build time (`noExternal`): aria-labelledby-before-aria-label precedence, the accname self-reference cycle guard, name-from-content for named widgets, sensitive-value redaction, accessible-name normalization, and the element-picker button fix. No inspector API changes — the previously published build shipped the older bundled engine.
