DomObserver: add a max-wait ceiling to the mutation debounce. The debounce was trailing-only, so a page that mutates faster than the debounce interval — streaming AI responses, progress bars, live tickers, animated `style` updates — kept resetting the timer and `onTreeChange` never fired, leaving consumers (the extension side panel, `testing`'s `flow()`/`waitForMutations`) frozen for the whole stream. A second, non-resetting ceiling timer now forces a flush at least every `maxWaitMs` (new optional constructor arg, default 1000ms, clamped to at least the debounce interval).

`testing`'s `waitForMutations` now threads its `timeout` through as the observer's ceiling, so the new default ceiling can't resolve a `timeout > 1000` wait early — its documented `timeout` contract is preserved.
