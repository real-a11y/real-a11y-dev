# @real-a11y-dev/mcp

## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- e2eca34: New package `@real-a11y-dev/browser` — the browser driver, extracted from `@real-a11y-dev/mcp` (the `BrowserSession`) and `@real-a11y-dev/testing` (the injected page-bundle and its IIFE build). It is the one place that touches Playwright: `BrowserSession` drives a real Chromium and injects the page-bundle that installs `window.__realA11y__`. Deps: `@real-a11y-dev/audit` + `@real-a11y-dev/serialize` + `@real-a11y-dev/core`, with an optional `playwright` peer.

  This completes the platform re-layering. The CLI, the MCP server, and the testing Playwright adapter now all drive the browser through this single package, so a tree captured by any of them is byte-for-byte identical — the bundle is built and resolved in exactly one place.

  - **`@real-a11y-dev/mcp`** imports `BrowserSession` from `@real-a11y-dev/browser` and **drops its `@real-a11y-dev/testing` dependency entirely** — the page-bundle was its last tie to the test-helper package. It also **removes the `./browser` subpath export**: import `BrowserSession` / `A11ySession` / `OpenOptions` / … from `@real-a11y-dev/browser` instead of `@real-a11y-dev/mcp/browser`.
  - **`@real-a11y-dev/cli`** imports the browser session from `@real-a11y-dev/browser` and **drops its `@real-a11y-dev/mcp` dependency** (it only wrapped mcp for the browser). Installing the CLI no longer pulls in the MCP SDK.
  - **`@real-a11y-dev/testing`** keeps its public API unchanged — `@real-a11y-dev/testing/playwright`'s `attach()` behaves identically. Internally its adapter now injects `@real-a11y-dev/browser`'s page-bundle (via the exported `PAGE_BUNDLE_PATH`) instead of building its own.

  Verified byte-for-byte against the CLI, MCP, and testing e2e suites.

- d693a00: Surface the focused element to agents. `get_semantic_tree`, `get_tab_order`, and `inspect_page` now mark the element focused at capture time with a trailing `[focused]` (inherited from the serialize layer), so an agent can see that opening a dialog moved focus into it, or which control a keyboard user is on. Tool descriptions note the marker.

  `compare_trees` explicitly opts out (`markFocus: false`): Chromium's native tree carries no focus marker, so a `[focused]` suffix on the custom side would register as a spurious custom-vs-native divergence.

- 84535a1: Add **a11y snapshot checkpoints** to the MCP server — six tools that give an AI agent the CLI's snapshot + diff power mid-session: capture a page, change something (deploy, feature toggle, DOM edit), then ask what accessibility findings are new / changed / fixed, with the _same_ `v1:` fingerprint identity the CI a11y-diff bot uses.

  - `checkpoint_findings` / `diff_findings` — snapshot the current page under a name, then re-snapshot and diff against it.
  - `diff_checkpoints` — diff two already-stored checkpoints.
  - `list_checkpoints` / `export_checkpoint` / `import_checkpoint` — inspect the store, and bridge to/from CLI-generated `a11y-snapshot.json` artifacts.

  Checkpoints are in-memory, LRU-capped (20), and **survive navigation by design** — so you can `checkpoint_findings("prod")`, open a preview URL, and `diff_findings("prod")` for a cross-deploy accessibility diff in one session. `close_browser` clears them.

  `@real-a11y-dev/snapshot` gains **`buildSnapshotPage()`** — the single capture→fingerprint assembler the CLI's `snapshot` command and the MCP server both call, so their fingerprints are identical (guarded by a cross-tool golden test). `@real-a11y-dev/cli`'s snapshot command re-points to it with byte-for-byte identical output.

- 91246b9: Make `producer: "native"` consistent across the MCP tools, and rename `compare_trees`.

  - **`producer: "native"` now works on every tree/findings/outline/list tool** — added to `get_semantic_tree`, `get_heading_outline`, and `list_elements` (it was already on `audit_page` / `inspect_page`). One rule: every tool that projects a tree/findings/outline/element-list takes `producer`; native is whole-document (`rootSelector` must be `"body"`).
  - **`get_tab_order` stays DOM-only** — a native tree carries no tab order, so the tool takes no `producer`.
  - **Removed `get_native_tree`** — it's now `get_semantic_tree` with `producer: "native"` (one canonical native tree, not two subtly-different serializations).
  - **Renamed `compare_trees` → `compare_producers`** — it diffs the DOM producer against the native producer (a _producer_ comparison at one instant), and the old name was easily confused with `diff_checkpoints` (a _temporal_ comparison of two checkpoints). It now compares against the same canonical native producer `get_semantic_tree { producer: "native" }` exposes, so a divergence it reports matches what you'd see there.

  Breaking for callers of `get_native_tree` (use `get_semantic_tree { producer: "native" }`) or `compare_trees` (use `compare_producers`).

- 484c49d: `audit_page` and `inspect_page` accept `producer: "native"` — audit Chromium's own accessibility tree.

  The default (`producer: "dom"`, unchanged) walks the page's light DOM. Passing `producer: "native"` runs the same audit over **Chromium's own accessibility tree** (read over CDP via `@real-a11y-dev/browser`'s `nativeTree`, serialized + audited in Node through `@real-a11y-dev/snapshot`'s `projectNativeTree`) — so it reaches structure no in-page walk can, most visibly a `<video controls>`'s play/scrubber/mute controls, which live in a closed user-agent shadow root. This is the difference between _viewing_ the native tree (`get_native_tree`, unchanged) and _auditing_ it.

  Native is whole-document and read-only: `rootSelector` must stay `"body"` (any other value is refused, since native can't scope), and a native tree carries no tab order — so `inspect_page`'s tab-order section reports N/A rather than an empty block. Chromium only.

- 0680dc9: Add **tree checkpoints** to the MCP server — the interaction diff. `checkpoint_tree` captures the current accessibility tree; after an interaction, `diff_tree` reports exactly which nodes were added, removed, or changed, plus where focus moved.

  Where the snapshot checkpoints answer _"what accessibility problems changed?"_, these answer _"what did that click change?"_ — making an interaction's effect legible: that opening a dialog added a `dialog` node **and** moved focus into it, or that a "Load more" button appended twelve links but left focus stranded.

  The captured tree lives **inside the page** — `@real-a11y-dev/browser`'s page-bundle gains `checkpointTree` / `diffSinceCheckpoint`, built on core's `diffTrees` and serialize's `serializeTreeDiff` — because node identities are realm-bound, so only the rendered diff ever crosses the boundary. That makes a tree checkpoint **page-instance-bound**: it is discarded on navigation, the deliberate asymmetry with snapshot checkpoints, which survive it. `diff_tree` re-extracts with the root the checkpoint was captured with unless you override it, so the comparison stays like-for-like.

### Patch Changes

- cd87cd2: Import the audit engine from its canonical home, `@real-a11y-dev/audit`, instead of through `@real-a11y-dev/testing`'s re-export — production packages no longer reach the findings engine through the test-helper package.

  - **`@real-a11y-dev/cli` no longer depends on `@real-a11y-dev/testing` at all.** `Finding` / `A11yRule` / `ALL_RULES` / `INTERACTIVE_ROLES` now come from `@real-a11y-dev/audit`, and `ROLE_FILTER_GROUPS` from `@real-a11y-dev/core` (its real home). Installing the CLI no longer pulls in a test-runner-oriented package.
  - **`@real-a11y-dev/mcp`** imports `Finding` / `A11yRule` / `ALL_RULES` from `@real-a11y-dev/audit`. It still depends on `@real-a11y-dev/testing` for one thing only — the browser page-bundle (`page-bundle.iife.global.js`) it injects at runtime — and that remaining tie is removed when the browser layer is extracted to its own package.

  Pure re-point: the re-exported symbols are identical (audit is where they were always defined), so there is no public API or output change. Verified byte-for-byte against the CLI and MCP e2e suites.

### Minor Changes

- 9c3517c: The MCP server can now audit pages behind a login. Set `REAL_A11Y_MCP_STORAGE_STATE` to a saved Playwright storage-state file (create it out-of-band, e.g. with `real-a11y login`) and every page opens already authenticated — the session is operator-configured, never a tool parameter, so tokens never enter the agent's context. `REAL_A11Y_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` pins auditing to a comma-separated allowlist so a redirect can't route the session to an unintended site (the engine refuses extraction off-allowlist).

  The server validates the storage-state file at startup and refuses to boot if it's missing or malformed (a server that silently audits logged-out pages is worse than one that won't start), and rejects `STORAGE_STATE` combined with `REAL_A11Y_MCP_CDP`. When a session is loaded, `open_page` tells the agent so in its description and result — a boolean fact, never the path or contents — so it doesn't try to "fix" an already-authenticated page by logging in.

- 18dda52: New `@real-a11y-dev/mcp/browser` subpath export: `BrowserSession` (plus `OpenOptions`, `assertOpenableUrl`, and the session types) without loading the MCP SDK graph — the root export's module top-level imports the SDK and zod, which consumers that only want the browser session (like `@real-a11y-dev/cli`) shouldn't pay for. `BrowserSessionOptions` also gains an optional `proxy` pass-through to Chromium's launch options, since Chromium ignores `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` env vars on its own. The playwright peer is now marked optional (`peerDependenciesMeta`) to match the lazy import — importing the server API (or the browser subpath's types) never requires a browser install, and downstream packages with a playwright-free surface no longer inherit an unmet-peer warning. The root export is unchanged.
- 32fc4e6: New package `@real-a11y-dev/mcp` — a Model Context Protocol server that exposes the Real A11y semantic tree and accessibility audits to AI agents over stdio. Point any MCP client at it (`npx -y @real-a11y-dev/mcp`) and an agent can open a page and reason about what assistive tech actually perceives.

  Audit-first: `audit_page` runs the same rule engine as `@real-a11y-dev/testing` (`collectFindings`) and returns every violation — unlabeled controls, skipped heading levels, unlabeled dialogs, broken landmark structure — grouped and with per-instance CSS locators. `inspect_page` returns the findings plus the semantic tree, heading outline, and tab order from ONE extraction, so a multi-view report can't be internally inconsistent on a dynamic page. Perception primitives (`get_semantic_tree`, `get_heading_outline`, `get_tab_order`, `list_elements`) let it stand alone without a separate browser-automation MCP; `open_page` handles navigation, settle waits, and mobile/tablet device emulation.

  Two MCP-only tools cross-check the custom engine against the browser's own tree: `get_native_tree` reads Chromium's authoritative accessibility tree via CDP, and `compare_trees` diffs the two and reports where they disagree on role or accessible name — a fidelity oracle that surfaces custom-engine bugs.

  Playwright is a peer dependency, lazily imported, so importing the server API (`buildServer`, types) never requires a browser to be installed. `file://` navigation is refused by default (an LLM-driven local-file exfiltration primitive) unless `REAL_A11Y_MCP_ALLOW_FILE=1`.

- 18dda52: `BrowserSession` can now load an authenticated session and pin the audited origin — the engine half of auditing pages behind a login. `BrowserSessionOptions` gains `storageState` (a Playwright storage-state file path, loaded into every launched context so pages open already authenticated; it survives device-emulation context rebuilds and is rejected together with `cdpEndpoint`) and `allowedOrigins` (when set, extraction is refused unless the page's final post-redirect origin is in the allowlist — the control that stops a redirect from an intended target to a recorded cookie domain from silently auditing an unintended authenticated page). A new `captureStorageState()` method returns the current context's cookies + origin storage for a "save the session" flow. Auth material is always caller-configured, never derived from tool input. The agent-facing MCP server surface (env vars, tool descriptions) is unchanged in this release.
