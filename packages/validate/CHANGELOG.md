# @real-a11y-dev/validate

## 0.1.0-beta.7

### Minor Changes

- 1270667: New package `@real-a11y-dev/validate` — ARIA semantics validation over the accessibility tree. `validateNode` runs the per-node rules (valid role, required accessible name and attributes, direct required context); `validateTree` runs the relationship rules that need the whole tree — interactive nesting (a `link` inside a `button`), presentational-children misuse (interactive/composite content inside `button`/`link`/…), and required-owned containers (an empty `tablist`, `list`, …). Rules are `aria-query`-backed so they never drift from the spec, and everything runs over a minimal `ValidatedNode` shape, so a tree authored ahead of code or extracted from the DOM is checked by one engine. `@real-a11y-dev/core` stays dependency-free — the `aria-query` dependency lives here.

  `@real-a11y-dev/testing` gains a `toBeValidA11yTree()` matcher (Vitest + Jest, from the `@real-a11y-dev/testing/matchers` entry): it extracts an element's accessibility tree, runs both validators, and fails on ARIA errors — invalid roles, missing required names/attributes, and the relationship violations above.
