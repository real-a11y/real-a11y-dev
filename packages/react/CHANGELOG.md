## 0.1.0-beta.15

### Minor Changes

- 1e64037: Stop publishing `@real-a11y-dev/core`; the extraction engine is internal now.

  It was the first package on npm and it is the last to go internal. Nobody installs an extraction engine on purpose — they install a matcher, a panel, a command, or a server, and the engine arrives inside it. Every published package already bundled it in practice; this makes that official. With it, the published set is **six packages**, down from thirteen.

  **Nothing changes for you unless you imported `@real-a11y-dev/core` directly.** It moves to `devDependencies` and is bundled into all six, so they install fewer packages, not more — and each carries the exact engine version it was tested against, which is what `noExternal` already gave you unofficially.

  If you did import it directly (last published `0.1.0-beta.13`), 19 of its 69 names keep a published home:

  - `@real-a11y-dev/testing` re-exports the query and diff vocabulary — `findByRole`, `findAllByRole`, `diffTrees`, `getOutline`, `getTabSequence`, `linearize`, `ROLE_FILTER_GROUPS` — with `SemanticNode`, `ExtractionResult`, `TreeDiff`, `NodeChange`, `OutlineEntry`, `RoleFilter`, `FindByRoleOptions`, `ActionType` and `ActionResult`.
  - `@real-a11y-dev/react` and `@real-a11y-dev/inspector` re-export the node, action and config types their own signatures name: `SemanticNode`, `ExtractionResult`, `TreeViewMode`, `ActionRequest`, `ActionResult`, plus `SemanticNavigatorConfig` on the inspector.

  **The other 50 have no drop-in, and two of them are a real capability leaving: `extractA11yTree` and `extractDomTree`.** Building your own published tooling directly on the engine was a documented path in the getting-started guide, and it is not one any more. The replacement is a surface that carries the engine rather than an import: `real-a11y` for the shell and CI (`--format json`, `-o`), the MCP tools for an agent, `attach(page)` from `@real-a11y-dev/testing/playwright` for a Playwright suite, or `createInspector` / `<SemanticNavigator />` for a UI. Also gone without replacement: the live machinery (`LiveTreeExtractor`, `DomObserver`, `FocusManager`, `ActionDispatcher`, `createPicker`) and the native-AX vocabulary.

  Two consumers changed shape rather than just moving a dependency line. `react` externalized `core` and now bundles it, and `storybook-addon`'s `index` entry listed it under `external` — correct while core was published, wrong the moment it wasn't, since npm cannot resolve a private package in the JS or in the types. Both entries genuinely need it: `react`'s `index.ts` re-exports core types and `useActiveModal` imports the _value_ `findByRole`, and `storybook-addon`'s `TreeMode` **is** core's `TreeViewMode`.

  `inspector` had a latent version of the same gap — `noExternal` without the matching `dts.resolve` — which was harmless only because core was still published. Both halves are now paired everywhere.

### Patch Changes

- e5ea95a: Share the node-id registry and the element reference map across every copy of the engine in a realm.

  Both were plain module-scope state — `const elementRefs = new ElementRefMap()` and a `let counter` beside a `WeakMap<Node, string>`. That is correct while exactly one copy of the engine is loaded, and only then.

  More than one copy is the normal case. `@real-a11y-dev/inspector` already bundles the engine rather than importing it, and the same is true of the extension; anything that bundles it gets a private registry. When a node crosses that boundary the ids stop meaning the same thing: `dispatch()` in `@real-a11y-dev/testing` turns a node id back into a live `Element` through the ref map, so an extraction recorded in one copy is invisible to an action performed by another. The lookup misses, `dispatch` returns without doing anything, and nothing reports an error — a Radix slider stepped with `dispatch(slider, "decrement")` simply stays at 50. The id counter has the matching failure: two copies both start at zero and both hand out `sn-0`, for different nodes.

  Both now live in a realm-wide registry keyed by `Symbol.for()`, so every copy in the realm resolves the same object. Realm rather than process is the right scope — an iframe or a worker gets its own, which matches the DOM it describes, since `Element` identity does not cross those either.

  > **Retargeted when `core` went private.** This entry named `core` itself while
  > the engine was still published, and dependents would have cascaded from its
  > bump. A private package has no version to cascade from, so the consumers are
  > named directly — all six, because every published package bundles the engine
  > and the fix has to reach every tarball. Left as it was, it would also have
  > mixed an ignored package with non-ignored ones and thrown at
  > `changeset version`, breaking the release cut.

  No API change: `getElementRefs()`, `getNodeId()` and `resetIdCounter()` keep their signatures and their behaviour, including `resetIdCounter()` resetting only the counter and deliberately keeping the node→id map.

## 0.1.0-beta.11

### Minor Changes

- 35e99e6: Fix three ways the embeddable inspector stopped reacting after mount: a floating `<SemanticNavigator>` rendered an **empty panel** when its root ref was already set (the common `{open && <SemanticNavigator floating />}` toggle), `InspectorInstance.setViewMode()` and the `mode` prop left the rendered tree on the old view while `getTree()` already reported the new one, and `useSemanticTree`/`useActiveModal` never attached to a root that mounted after the first commit and kept observing a **replaced** root. `useSemanticTree` and `useActiveModal` now also accept the element itself (new `SemanticTreeTarget` type) — pass an element from a callback ref when the root mounts late or can be swapped; existing ref-object callers are unchanged.
- 907c68e: Add `LiveTreeExtractor` for incremental DOM and accessibility tree updates.

  `@real-a11y-dev/core` now exposes a `LiveTreeExtractor` class that keeps the
  previous extraction in memory and re-extracts only the dirty subtrees reported
  by `DomObserver`. It falls back to a full extraction when a mutation can affect
  non-local accessibility state (modal/portal scope, `id`, `aria-labelledby`,
  `aria-describedby`, `for`, etc.). The result is the same `ExtractionResult`
  shape as `extractA11yTree` / `extractDomTree`.

  `DomObserver` callbacks now receive an optional `TreeChange` payload containing
  the accumulated `MutationRecord`s and synthetic dirty roots from `input`/`change`
  events, which `LiveTreeExtractor.refresh(change)` consumes.

  The Chrome extension, React `useSemanticTree` hook, and Storybook addon preview
  have been wired to use `LiveTreeExtractor` so live updates avoid a full page
  re-extraction when only a small region changed.

### Patch Changes

- 9a16451: Fix `<SemanticNavigator>` freezing inspector config props after mount. `theme`, `interactive`, `highlightOnHover`, `scrollHostOnSelect`, `focusHostOnActivate`, and `enablePicker` now remount when they change (they were closed over in an effect that only depended on root/mount/host). `onNodeSelect` / `onAction` use ref-backed stable wrappers so a parent that recreates the callback each render always invokes the latest closure — previously handlers read stale state indefinitely. The misleading "updated imperatively below" comment is gone; only `mode` still updates via `setViewMode` without remounting. (`styleNonce` remains mount-only — the inspector reuses the host's shadow root and injects the stylesheet once.)

## 0.1.0-beta.6

### Minor Changes

- 488ca27: Add the DevTools-style element picker to the React inline panel.
  Same UX as the Chrome extension's picker (toolbar `⦿` button +
  `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+C` shortcut + crosshair cursor + capture-phase
  clicks that `preventDefault` the page handler); when the user
  clicks an element on the host page, the matching tree row is
  selected and scrolled into view.

  Public surface changes:
  - `@real-a11y-dev/core` exports `createPicker(options)` returning
    `{ isEnabled, setEnabled, teardown }`. Moved from
    `@real-a11y-dev/semantic-navigator-extension` (which was private,
    so this is a pure additive export). `SemanticNavigatorConfig`
    gains `enablePicker?: boolean` (default `false`).
  - `@real-a11y-dev/semantic-navigator-ui` — `TreeView`, `TreePanel`,
    and `TreeToolbar` accept `enablePicker` / `pickModeOn` /
    `onTogglePickMode` / `pickedNodeId` / `onPickedNodeHandled`.
    `.sn-pick-btn` styles (shipped earlier with the extension fix in
    PR #81) now have a consumer here too.
  - `@real-a11y-dev/inspector` — `createInspector` reads the new
    `enablePicker` flag from the config and passes it to TreeView.
  - `@real-a11y-dev/react` — `<SemanticNavigator>` gains the matching
    `enablePicker` prop.

  The Chrome extension was already a consumer of `createPicker` and
  now imports it from `@real-a11y-dev/core` instead of its own local
  copy. No behavior change there — same module, same tests, same
  coverage.

  `examples/react-app` flips `enablePicker={true}` so the demo
  surfaces the button. Click `⦿`, hover the page, click any element
  — the panel jumps to the row.
